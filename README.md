# TalentView: Workforce Risk & Retention Analytics

## Project Overview
TalentView is a Power BI–based HR analytics project designed to help organizations understand employee attrition, workforce composition, and hiring effectiveness.

The project focuses on identifying:
- Attrition risk drivers
- Manager-level turnover patterns
- Early warning signals

This is achieved using advanced DAX, AI visuals, and secure data modeling practices.

## Business Problem
The organization is experiencing high employee turnover, but HR leadership lacks clear answers to:

- Why employees are leaving
- Which departments and managers are most affected
- Whether current hiring practices are effective
- How attrition risk is evolving over time

Without data-driven insights, retention strategies remain reactive rather than proactive.

## Dataset
- **Source:** IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition Dataset (simulated HRIS data)
- **Records:** ~1,400 employees
- **Key Attributes:**
  - Department, Job Role, Manager
  - Salary, Tenure, Experience
  - Attrition Status (Voluntary / Involuntary)
  - Demographics (Age, Gender, Education)

Personally Identifiable Information (PII) was anonymized during data preparation.

## Week-Wise Project Execution

### Week 1: Data Understanding, Cleaning & Anonymization

**Objective**  
To understand the HR dataset structure and prepare it for enterprise-level workforce analysis.

**Key Activities**
- Imported raw HR data into Power BI using Power Query
- Assessed data quality issues (nulls, inconsistencies, duplicates)
- Cleaned and standardized fields (department names, job roles, dates)
- Anonymized sensitive employee identifiers
- Created derived columns for age group, tenure band, and salary band

**Outcome**  
A clean, analysis-ready dataset suitable for workforce modeling and attrition analysis.

### Week 2: Data Modeling & Core DAX Metrics

**Objective**  
To build a scalable data model and calculate foundational workforce metrics.

**Data Model**
- **Dimension Tables:**
  - Employee
  - Department
  - Demographics
- **Fact Tables:**
  - Headcount (monthly snapshots)
  - Separations (employee exits)

A star-schema-style model was used to support time-based analysis.

**Core DAX Measures Created**
- Headcount
- New Hires
- Separations
- Average Tenure

**Outcome**  
Validated headcount and attrition numbers with correct filtering across departments, managers, and time.

### Week 3: Advanced Metrics & Analytical Dashboards

**Objective**  
To move from basic reporting to attrition risk analysis and hiring effectiveness.

**Advanced DAX Measures**
- Attrition Rate % (Rolling 12 Months)
- Voluntary vs Involuntary Attrition
- Time-to-Hire metrics

**Dashboards Built**

**1. Workforce Overview**
- KPI cards (Headcount, Average Tenure)
- Headcount by Department
- Demographic distribution (Gender, Age Group, Education)

**2. Attrition Analysis**
- Monthly attrition trends
- Separations by reason (Waterfall chart)
- Department- and manager-level drill-downs

**AI Analysis**
- Implemented Key Influencers visual to identify drivers of attrition
- Salary and Manager emerged as key contributors to voluntary exits

**Outcome**  
Clear identification of high-risk departments and attrition drivers.

### Week 4: Security, Optimization & Deployment Readiness

**Objective**  
To align the dashboard with real-world enterprise HR analytics standards.

**Row-Level Security (RLS)**
- Managers can view only their own teams
- HR Business Partners can view assigned departments
- HR leadership has full organizational visibility

**Enhancements**
- Added slicers and bookmarks for smooth navigation
- Improved UI consistency and readability
- Optimized visuals for leadership consumption

**Deployment**
- Published to Power BI Service
- Configured and tested RLS roles

**Outcome**  
A secure, multi-page HR analytics solution ready for organizational use.

## Key Insights
- Attrition is concentrated in specific departments rather than evenly distributed
- Certain managers show consistently higher turnover
- Compensation misalignment increases early-tenure attrition
- Hiring speed alone does not offset retention issues

## Business Recommendations
- Introduce manager-level retention accountability
- Review salary structures for high-risk roles
- Strengthen onboarding for early-tenure employees
- Monitor rolling attrition trends instead of static rates

## Tools & Technologies
- Power BI Desktop
- Power Query
- DAX
- AI Key Influencers Visual
- Power BI Service (RLS)
